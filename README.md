# EdgeDetectorGUI
## This Python GUI program creates a graphical user interface (GUI) 
for real-time edge detection using the Canny edge detection algorithm with OpenCV and tkinter. 
The GUI allows the user to adjust the upper and lower limits of the Canny algorithm and displays the live video feed from a webcam with the detected edges overlaid on top. \
